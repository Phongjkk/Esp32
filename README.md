# Esp32
Using ESP32 and DHT11 to measure temperature and humidity and display them on Blink.
This project was completed in three days, therefore it only applies basic ESP32 programming, including reading data from sensors, connecting to Wi-Fi, and sending data to Blink.
I forgot to record a video, but I demonstrated the product during the on-campus defense and received an A.
